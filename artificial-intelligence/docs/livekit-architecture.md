Architecture Overview: LiveKit, ElevenLabs v3 & WebRTC
This document outlines the architecture of a real-time communication system utilising the LiveKit platform, which is built on WebRTC, and integrates with ElevenLabs' v3 speech synthesis models for advanced AI-driven audio experiences.
1. Core Technologies
• WebRTC (Web Real-Time Communication): This is the foundational technology that enables peer-to-peer streaming of audio, video, and arbitrary data directly between browsers and applications without needing plugins. It is optimised for media, resilient to poor network conditions, and natively supported by modern browsers. Key components include RTCPeerConnection for managing connections between peers, MediaStream for audio/video tracks, and RTCDataChannel for arbitrary data exchange.
• LiveKit: An open-source platform that simplifies the development of real-time media applications by managing the complexities of production-grade WebRTC infrastructure. It provides scalable media servers, comprehensive SDKs for various platforms, and a rich ecosystem for building features like AI assistants, video conferencing, and interactive livestreaming.
• ElevenLabs v3: An advanced, emotionally rich speech synthesis model designed for creating natural, life-like speech. It is particularly effective for character discussions, audiobook production, and emotional dialogue, supporting over 70 languages. While not intended for ultra-low-latency real-time applications itself, it can be used to generate high-quality audio assets that are then streamed via LiveKit. For real-time conversational AI, other models like Eleven Flash v2.5 are recommended due to their low latency.
2. System Architecture Diagram (Mermaid JS)
Here is a Mermaid JS diagram illustrating how these components interact. This shows a common use case where a client application connects to a LiveKit Room, and an AI Agent (powered by your backend server and ElevenLabs) also joins the room to interact with the user.

3. Detailed Component Breakdown & Flow
Here is a step-by-step explanation of the architecture shown in the diagram.
3.1. LiveKit Ecosystem Core Components
• LiveKit Server: This is the central media server that routes audio, video, and data streams between participants in a 'Room'. It handles all the complex WebRTC signalling, network traversal (ICE, STUN, TURN), and media encoding/decoding management. You can use the fully managed LiveKit Cloud or self-host it on your own infrastructure.
• LiveKit SDKs: These are developer-friendly libraries for web, mobile, and backend applications. They provide a consistent API to connect to rooms, publish media tracks (like a user's microphone), and subscribe to tracks from other participants.
• Server APIs & Webhooks: LiveKit provides a REST API and webhooks for backend management of rooms and participants. This allows your application server to create rooms, grant access, and monitor events programmatically.
3.2. WebRTC Layer
• Peer-to-Peer Foundation: Although LiveKit uses a media server (SFU - Selective Forwarding Unit) to scale to many participants, the underlying transport is WebRTC. Each client establishes a secure RTCPeerConnection with the LiveKit Server.
• Media & Data Tracks: A user's camera and microphone are captured as MediaStreamTrack objects and published to the server. Other participants subscribe to these tracks. Arbitrary data can be sent via RTCDataChannel for things like text chat or game state synchronisation.
• Signalling: The process of setting up a WebRTC connection involves exchanging session descriptions (SDP) and network candidate information (ICE). LiveKit's SDKs and Server handle this entire negotiation process, abstracting it away from the developer.
3.3. ElevenLabs Integration
• Model Selection: The choice of ElevenLabs model is critical and depends on the use case.
    ◦ eleven_v3: Best for high-quality, non-real-time audio generation like narrations or character dialogues that can be pre-rendered. It has a high emotional range but is not suitable for low-latency conversational agents.
    ◦ eleven_flash_v2_5: The recommended choice for real-time applications like voice agents due to its ultra-low latency (~75ms).
    ◦ eleven_turbo_v2_5: A balanced model offering higher quality than Flash with low latency (~250-300ms).
• API Interaction: Your backend's AI Agent logic would make requests to the ElevenLabs API (either via HTTP or WebSockets for lower latency). For a conversational agent, the flow would be:
    1. The AI logic determines a response.
    2. It sends the text to the ElevenLabs API (e.g., using the Flash v2.5 model).
    3. ElevenLabs returns the synthesised audio stream.
    4. The backend agent, connected to the LiveKit room as a participant, publishes this audio stream as a MediaStreamTrack for other participants to hear.
3.4. Architectural Flow in Practice
1. Authentication: A user's client app requests access from your Application Server. The server verifies the user and generates a time-limited LiveKit Access Token specifying the user's identity and the room they can join.
2. Connection: The client-side LiveKit SDK uses this token to establish a secure WebSocket connection to the LiveKit Server, which then negotiates a WebRTC peer connection.
3. Publishing Media: The client publishes its local audio and video tracks to the LiveKit Server.
4. AI Agent Joins: Your backend spawns an AI Agent. This agent uses a server-side LiveKit SDK and another access token to join the same room as a participant.
5. Real-time Interaction:
    ◦ The AI Agent subscribes to the user's audio track.
    ◦ The audio is processed (e.g., transcribed to text).
    ◦ The AI logic formulates a text response.
    ◦ This text is sent to the ElevenLabs API (e.g., Flash v2.5 model).
    ◦ The returned audio stream is published by the AI Agent back into the LiveKit room.
6. Receiving Media: The user's client app automatically subscribes to the AI Agent's newly published audio track and plays it back, completing the conversational loop. All media is routed efficiently through the LiveKit Server.
