# LiveKit Architecture

This document contains a Mermaid diagram that visualizes the core LiveKit architecture: clients, signaling, SFU routing, TURN/STUN, recording/ingestion, and optional external services.

  # LiveKit Architecture (Mermaid)

  This document shows a concise, easy-to-read diagram of a typical LiveKit deployment. The diagram highlights the main components and the primary media/signaling flows:

  - Clients: web, mobile, and SDK-based participants
  - Signaling: connection and room control (WSS/websocket)
  - SFU Router: real-time media routing for efficient multi-party audio/video
  - TURN/STUN: NAT traversal for peer connectivity
  - Recording / RTMP ingest: capture or stream-out components
  - Storage: object store for recorded media or assets
  - CDN / RTMP: optional streaming/ingest paths

  The Mermaid block below renders the diagram on GitHub and in editors that support Mermaid.

  ## How to use

  - Edit the Mermaid `flowchart` block to reflect your deployment (for example, add separate SFU worker pools, load balancers, or separate ingest clusters).
  - GitHub renders Mermaid diagrams inside Markdown files automatically â€” open this file in the repo to see the diagram.
  - For higher-fidelity or exportable images, consider using the Mermaid CLI (`mmdc`) in CI to generate PNG/SVG artifacts.

  ## Component notes

  - Signaling: handles room join/leave, participant metadata, and connection negotiation. Implemented over WSS.
  - SFU Router: relays media streams, handles simulcast, and performs RTP-level routing. Scales horizontally with worker nodes.
  - TURN/STUN: provides NAT traversal when direct peer connectivity is not possible.
  - Recording / RTMP Ingest: optional components that capture streams for storage or broadcast.
  - Storage: object stores (S3, GCS) used for saving recordings, logs, and assets.

  You can expand this diagram with swimlanes, more detailed subgraphs, or use `graph TD` for layered flows.
