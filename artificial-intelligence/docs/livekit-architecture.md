# LiveKit + ElevenLabs Architecture

This document describes a production-ready architecture for a real-time voice agent using LiveKit (WebRTC) and ElevenLabs' speech models.

## ðŸš€ Key Technologies

* **WebRTC**: The foundational real-time media transport protocol (`RTCPeerConnection`, `MediaStream`, `RTCDataChannel`). It enables direct browser-to-browser communication.
* **LiveKit**: A scalable, open-source WebRTC platform that provides a Selective Forwarding Unit (SFU), SDKs, and server APIs/webhooks to simplify building real-time applications.
* **ElevenLabs**: A service providing high-quality, natural-sounding speech synthesis. For real-time conversational agents, the low-latency `eleven_flash_v2_5` model is recommended.

# LiveKit + ElevenLabs Architecture

This document explains a production-ready architecture for a real-time voice agent using LiveKit (WebRTC) and ElevenLabs. It contains a single, GitHub-friendly Mermaid diagram, component notes, a typical interaction flow, and tips for rendering.

## Key technologies

- **WebRTC** â€” real-time media transport (`RTCPeerConnection`, `MediaStream`, `RTCDataChannel`)
- **LiveKit** â€” scalable SFU, SDKs, and server APIs/webhooks
- **ElevenLabs** â€” high-quality speech synthesis (consider `eleven_flash_v2_5` for low-latency scenarios)

## Architecture diagram (Mermaid)

The diagram below uses compact node labels and `graph TD` so GitHub's Mermaid renderer handles it reliably.

```mermaid

## Component notes

- **Auth Service**: Issues short-lived LiveKit tokens and controls room permissions.
- **App Server**: Orchestrates room lifecycle, issues tokens, and manages control-plane actions.
- **AI Agent**: Joins rooms (or uses egress/ingress), subscribes to audio, runs models/transcription, and publishes synthesized audio.
- **ElevenLabs Adapter**: Calls ElevenLabs APIs to synthesize audio for the AI Agent to publish.
- **LiveKit SFU**: Routes publish/subscribe media; use server API/webhooks for room events.

## Typical interaction flow

1. Client requests a LiveKit token from App Server.
2. Client connects to LiveKit SFU using that token (WSS) and establishes PeerConnections.
3. Client publishes microphone/audio tracks to the SFU.
4. App Server launches or signals an AI Agent into the room.
5. Agent subscribes to user audio, transcribes/processes it, generates a response, and sends text to ElevenLabs.
6. ElevenLabs returns synthesized audio; Agent publishes the audio track back into the room.
7. Clients hearing the room receive and play the AI audio.

## Tips for reliable rendering

- Refer to the Mermaid docs: https://mermaid.js.org/intro/ for syntax and examples.
- Keep labels short and avoid punctuation like parentheses and slashes inside node IDs/labels.
- For deterministic previews, add a GitHub Action to run the Mermaid CLI (`mmdc`) to output an SVG into `docs/diagrams`.

If you want, I can add a small GitHub Action that renders this diagram to `docs/diagrams/livekit-architecture.svg`, or open a PR from `dev-101` to `main` with this change.
